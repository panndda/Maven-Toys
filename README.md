Maven Toys is a chain of toy stores in Mexico. The entity maintains a database which houses information about it's products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.
This exploratory analysis was conducted as a response to the capstone project assigned during my participation in the Utiva Data Analytics Bootcamp.
The datasets are also included in the repository.

## Business Questions ❓❔
Queries were to be written to answer the following business questions as required;

1. Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store
locations?
2. How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?
3. Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?

Beyond the business questions outlined by the capstone project, I independently formulated a supplementary set of business questions to be addressed using the available dataset. They include;

4. Which store location has the highest revenue contribution to the total sales?
5. What is the average number of units sold per week for each product through the years?
6. Which store has the highest inventory turnover rate (units sold / stock on hand)?
7. What are the top 5 selling Products by units?
8. Which product categories have shown the highest growth in sales revenue over the past year?
